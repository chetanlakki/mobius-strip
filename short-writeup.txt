ðŸ“ŒHow I Structured the Code
Created a MobiusStrip class with constructor to set radius, width, and resolution.

Used NumPy for mesh generation (u, v, meshgrid) and parametric equations.

Created plot(), surface_area(), and edge_length() methods for functionality separation.

ðŸ“Œ How I Approximated Surface Area
Used finite differences (np.gradient) to estimate local area elements across the mesh grid.

Summed up those elements scaled by differential steps in u and v space.

ðŸ“Œ Challenges Faced
Initially used wrong constructor name (init instead of _init_).

Faced syntax issues in gradient calculations (dy[0]2 instead of dy[0]**2).

Had to adjust mesh resolution to ensure a smooth-looking strip in the 3D plot.
